Given an array of size n, Find the subarray with least average of size k.

Examples : 

Input:  arr[] = {3, 7, 90, 20, 10, 50, 40}, k = 3
Output: Subarray between indexes 3 and 5
The subarray {20, 10, 50} has the least average 
among all subarrays of size 3.

Input:  arr[] = {3, 7, 5, 20, -10, 0, 12}, k = 2
Output: Subarray between [4, 5] has minimum average
